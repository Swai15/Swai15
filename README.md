- 👋 Hey, my name is Swai, and I’m interested in becoming a web developer. Starterd out in June, and I'm currently learning Vanilla Javascript while working on TOP's curriculum's recommended projects. I can't wait to explore the new technologies ahead of me as well as work towards specializing in the backend when the time comes.

- ⏱ I'm currently learning Vanilla JavaScript and soon, React. Check out what I've been working on as part of my learning in my repos.
